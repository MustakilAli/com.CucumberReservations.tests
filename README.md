DO NOT WORK ON MASTER BRANCH! 

Instead, create your own branch. I suggest working on one test case at a time and pushing it to GitHub.

For example, you are starting work on Test Case 1:

1. "git checkout -b TestCase1" - this creates and switches to that local (on your machine) branch
2. Create your page object in pages package.
3. Create your test in tests package.
4. "git add ."
5. "git commit -m "your message here about your testcase""
6. "git push -u origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME"
7. "git checkout master"
8. git pull
9. repeat steps 1-8

All pages go into pages package.
All tests go into tests package.
Please use provided framework and follow readme files in the pages and tests folders.
